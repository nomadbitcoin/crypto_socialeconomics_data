The cryptography used by Tidecoin is falcon-512 which is one of NIST(National Institute of Standards and Technology)\'s finalists for Post-Quantum security standards. \n\t\t\tThis will make Tidecoin to keep on ensuring its security characteristics even faced with quantum computers. </p>\n</div>\n<div id="body">\n<div id="content">\n<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p> 09/Dec/2020, "Photonic Quantum Computer Displays \'Supremacy\' Over Supercomputers", a news from spectrum.ieee.org. It clearly shows that billions value on bitcoin network is facing the threat of Quantum computers. It is time to build a Post-Quantum security cryptocurrency.\n\t\t\t\tTidecoin is an attempt to build a quantum secure cryptocurrency.</p>\n<p>Tidecoin is a peer-to-peer Internet currency that enables instant, near-zero cost payments to anyone in the world. Tidecoin is an open source global payment network, and fully decentralized without any central authorities. Features of Post-Quantum security make Tidecoin as a replacement to Bitcoin. Tidecoin\'s new cryptography algorithm of Falcon is an lattice-based cryptography algorithm and based on the theoretical framework of Gentry, Peikert and Vaikuntanathan. There is no efficient solving algorithm currently known in the general case, even with the help of quantum computers, because the underlying hard problem is the short integer solution problem (SIS) over NTRU lattices. \n\t\t\t</p>\n<h2>Features    </h2>\n<p>The feature of Tidecoin.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t</p><li>NIST\'s Post-Quantum security standard</li>\n<li>Open Source Software </li>\n<li>Total supply: 21000000 TDC</li>\n<li>Pow only consencus, no pre-mined, no ico</li>\n<li>Segwit supported, reduce block size largely</li>\n<li>One minute block time, faster payment</li>\n<li>CPU friendly Pow algorithm, more inclusive</li>\n<li>Exponential increase halving time\xef\xbc\x9a0.5, 1, 2, 4, ...Years</li>\n<p></p>\n<h2> Post-Quantum security signature algorithm</h2>\n<p>\n\t\t   \nFalcon - Fast-Fourier Lattice-based Compact Signatures over NTRU. Falcon follows a framework introduced in 2008 by Gentry, Peikert, and Vaikuntanathan, the high-level idea is the following:\n</p><p>The public key is a long basis of a q-ary lattice. The private key is (essentially) a short basis of the same lattice. \nIn the signing procedure, the signer:</p>\n<li>\tGenerates a random value salt</li>\n<li>\tComputes a target c=H(msg||salt), where H is a hash function sending an input to a random-looking point (on the grid)</li>\n<li>\tUses his knowledge of a short basis to compute a lattice point v close to the target c</li>\n<li>\tOutputs (salt, s), where s=c\xe2\x88\x92v</li>\n<p></p>\n<p>In the verifying procedure, The verifier accepts the signature (salt, s)</p>\n<li>\tif and only if the vector s is short<p></p>\n</li><li>\tH(msg||salt) \xe2\x88\x92s is a point on the lattice generated by his public key.</li>\n<p></p>\n<p>Falcon offers the following features:</p>\n<li>Security: a true Gaussian sampler is used internally, which guarantees negligible leakage of information on the secret key up to a practically infinite number of signatures (more than 264). To give a point of comparison, Falcon-512 is roughly equivalent, \nin classical security terms, to RSA-2048, whose signatures and public keys use 256 bytes each.</li>\n<li>Compactness: thanks to the use of NTRU lattices, signatures are substantially shorter than in any lattice-based signature scheme with the same security guarantees, while the public keys are around the same size.</li>\n<li>Speed: use of fast Fourier sampling allows for very fast implementations, in the thousands of signatures per second on a common computer; verification is five to ten times faster.</li>\n<li>Scalability: operations have cost O (n log n) for degree n, allowing the use of very long-term security parameters at moderate cost.</li>\n<li>RAM Economy: the enhanced key generation algorithm of Falcon uses less than 30 kilobytes of RAM, a hundredfold improvement over previous design such as NTRU Sign. Falcon is compatible with small, memory-constrained embedded devices.</li>\n<p></p>\n</div>\n<div class="clear"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id="footer">\n<div class="footer-content">\n<div id="footer-box-about">\n<h4>About Tidecoin</h4>\n<p>\n                    Tidecoin is an open source software from developers around the world.  \n                </p>\n</div>\n<div id="footer-box-index">\n<h4>Support this project by donating:</h4>\n<li>\n\t\t\t\tTDC: TQKzU6MGrUXcaxmCAXdwtQRR3zsMstEgXG\n                </li>\n<li>\n\t\t\t\tBTC: 1QDi6XkNLjCVNpCpQaAms6UEahEjACB4xg\n                </li>\n<li>\n\t\t\t\tETH: 0xfDd1b37d01a2134b8EeB19c182305c3055B54416\n                </li>\n</div>\n<div class="clear"></div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</body></html>'
